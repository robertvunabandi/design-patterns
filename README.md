# README

This repository is meant to provide examples of design patterns
and how a given project can be improved by using the various design
patterns.

A lot of this book is inspired and/or coming directory from the
book [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented/dp/149207800X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=H5JON78UN3V9&dchild=1&keywords=head+first+design+patterns&qid=1628564713&sprefix=head+first+desi%2Caps%2C147&sr=8-1)
2nd Edition.

# Structure

- **`<root>/src`**
   - This is the root of the project. It contains a `Main` file which
     will mostly have things that test out various parts of the code
     and things that can be ran. I see that file as a "playground" to
     try out different things from the various design patterns.
- **`<root>/src/<design-pattern-name>`**
   - This contains an example of the design pattern.
   - The subfolders will always be a `/bad` (how code can be written
     in a bad way) and a `/good` (how that same code can be refactored
     using the design pattern). These codes will mostly be coming from
     the book.
   - There will also be a `README` linking to the definition of that
     design pattern.

# Other Information

The code from the book is actually public at the following link:
https://wickedlysmart.com/head-first-design-patterns/. So, anyone
can download it. In this repo, I will tweak things slightly to
improve on various patterns that I add.

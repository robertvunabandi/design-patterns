Head First Design Pattern Definition:

> The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms,
> encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
> Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
> clients that use it.

Design principles that the Strategy design pattern follow:
1. Identify aspects of your application that vary and separate them from
   what stays the same.
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
3. Favor composition over inheritance.
